But what does this really mean? What does it actually look like?</p><p>According to marriage and family therapist Michael Morgan, teaching people how to treat us is a process that involves teaching them “what is acceptable and unacceptable. It is knowing what we need and want and being able to communicate it effectively to others.”</p><p>This isn’t the same thing as always being right, said Josephine Wiseheart, MS, a psychotherapist at Oliver-Pyatt Centers, and in private practice in Miami, Fla. “Someone disagreeing with us is not the same as being demeaned, diminished or devalued.”</p><p>So how can you teach others to treat you well? Below, Morgan and Wiseheart shared their specific tips.</p><h2>Start with yourself.</h2><p>“To teach people how to treat you, you do not begin with them, you begin with yourself,” said Wiseheart. Morgan agreed: “The way you believe about and treat yourself sets the standard for others on how you demand to be treated. People learn how to treat you based on what you accept from them.”</p><p>Wiseheart regularly tells her clients to “Be the pebble.” In other words, “to create even a seemingly small amount of change will ripple out and create more change.”</p><h2>Talk about your “rules of engagement.”</h2><p>One of the biggest misconceptions Wiseheart’s clients have about relationships is that others should know how they want to be treated. However, “in order for people in a relationship to be on the same page, they need to have access to the same instruction manual,” she said.</p><p>She calls this manual the “Rules of Engagement.” She suggests having “business meetings” to discuss the “rules” of your relationship. Have these meetings when people are at their best: They aren’t in an emotionally heightened or vulnerable situation, she said.</p><h2>Communicate your needs clearly and compassionately.</h2><p>For instance, many couples criticize, yell, or give each other the silent treatment to communicate their needs, said Morgan, who practices at Wasatch Family Therapy. This not only is ineffective, but it also hurts your relationship.</p><p>“Rather than scream ‘you never listen to me,’ it is more helpful to express ‘I feel alone right now and I would be very grateful if I could have your undivided attention for 10 minutes,’” he said. Another example is: “I am feeling overwhelmed right now and would love it if I could get a few ideas from you.”</p></div><div class="menu__panel"><h3 class="menu__title">Info</h3><ul class="menu__list"><li><a href="/">Home </a></li><li><a href="/about">About </a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></div><div class="menu__panel"><h3 class="menu__title">Categories</h3><ul class="menu__list"><li><a href="/success">Success</a></li><li><a href="/fear">Fear</a></li></ul></div><footer> <div class="footer"><div>&copy; 2021 &quot;Raluca Ghintuiala&quot;</div><ul class="footer__list"><li><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a></li><li><a href="/terms">Terms</a></li></ul></div></footer></div></body></html>
